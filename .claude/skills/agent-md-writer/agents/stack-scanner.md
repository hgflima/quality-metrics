# Subagent Prompt: Tech Stack & Structure Scanner

Prompt template for the `agent-md-writer` skill. Spawned via `Task` with `subagent_type: "Explore"`.

## How the skill uses this

Parallelize with `context7-detector` and `design-md-detector` during Step 0.5 (in `/agent-md:create` and `/agent-md:update` modes). The skill consumes the returned report to fill the `Tech Stack`, `Project Structure`, and `Development` sections of the generated onboarding file.

Substitute `{project_path}` with the absolute project root before spawning.

Skip this subagent entirely in `/agent-md:audit` mode — audit is read-only against the existing file and doesn't need fresh stack data.

## Task

You are a read-only scanner. Build a compact, structured report of this project's tech stack, folder layout, and day-one commands. The report will be pasted into a `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` file, so precision matters — no guesses, no speculation.

### Project path

`{project_path}`

### Part 1 — Tech stack

Detect language, framework, runtime, database, and key libraries by reading **manifest files only** (no source scanning). Check in order, read whichever exist:

- `package.json` — Node.js / frontend / TypeScript
- `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, `Pipfile` — Python
- `Cargo.toml` — Rust
- `go.mod` — Go
- `Gemfile`, `*.gemspec` — Ruby
- `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts` — Java/Kotlin/Scala
- `*.csproj`, `*.fsproj`, `packages.config` — .NET
- `pubspec.yaml` — Flutter/Dart
- `mix.exs` — Elixir
- `composer.json` — PHP
- `deno.json`, `deno.jsonc`, `bun.lockb` — Deno/Bun

Extract:

- **Primary language** (with version if specified)
- **Framework** (Next.js, Django, Rails, Spring Boot, etc. — only if obvious from dependencies)
- **Runtime** (Node version, Python version, Go version, etc.)
- **Database** (only if a driver is in the manifest: `pg`, `mysql2`, `prisma`, `sqlalchemy`, `diesel`, etc.)
- **Key libraries** — maximum 4. Only libraries that **shape how code is written** (ORM, UI framework, state management, testing framework). Skip utility libs like lodash, date-fns.

Do **not** read source files. If the manifest doesn't make something clear, leave it blank.

### Part 2 — Folder structure

Use Glob and `list_dir`-equivalent behavior to map the top-level layout. Target: 4–8 directories that someone needs on day one.

- Run `Glob` on `{project_path}/*` (top-level only, no recursion)
- Filter out: `node_modules`, `.git`, `.venv`, `venv`, `dist`, `build`, `target`, `.next`, `.nuxt`, `out`, `coverage`, `.turbo`, `.cache`
- For each remaining directory, note:
  - Its name
  - Its purpose in one short clause (inferred from name + contents you observe in top-level listing; do NOT read files inside)

Common conventions:

- `src/` → "source code"
- `app/` → "Next.js App Router" or "main application"
- `pages/` → "Next.js pages router" or "routing"
- `components/` → "UI components"
- `lib/` → "shared utilities and business logic"
- `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `spec/` → "test suite"
- `docs/` → "documentation"
- `public/`, `static/` → "static assets"

### Part 3 — Day-one commands

Extract the essential commands from the manifest. Do not invent commands you can't verify from the manifest.

**For package.json:** read the `scripts` object. Report the names (not the contents) of scripts matching:

- `install`, `dev`, `start`, `test`, `build`, `lint`, `format`, `typecheck`

**For pyproject.toml** (Poetry/Rye/uv): look for `[tool.poetry.scripts]`, `[project.scripts]`, or note standard commands (`pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy`).

**For Cargo.toml**: the commands are standard (`cargo build`, `cargo test`, `cargo run`). Note if there's a `[workspace]` or non-default binary.

**For go.mod**: standard (`go build`, `go test ./...`, `go run .`).

**For Gemfile**: `bundle install`, then `rails s` / `rake test` / etc.

Leave unclear categories blank rather than guessing.

### Output format (strict)

```
LANGUAGE: <language + version or "unknown">
FRAMEWORK: <framework name + version or "none">
RUNTIME: <e.g., "Node >= 18" or "unknown">
DATABASE: <detected from driver, or "none">
KEY_LIBRARIES:
  - <lib1 — one-line reason, e.g., "Prisma — ORM">
  - <lib2 — ...>
  (max 4; "none" if no high-signal libraries)

FOLDER_STRUCTURE:
  - <dir1>/ — <one-line purpose>
  - <dir2>/ — <one-line purpose>
  (4–8 entries; only top-level, only non-trivial)

COMMANDS:
  install: <command or "unknown">
  dev: <command or "unknown">
  test: <command or "unknown">
  build: <command or "unknown">
  lint: <command or "unknown">
  typecheck: <command or "unknown">

MANIFEST_FILES_READ:
  - <path1>
  - <path2>

OBSERVATIONS: <0–2 short sentences about anything non-obvious that affects the onboarding file — e.g., monorepo structure, multiple languages in one repo, unusual build system>
```

### Constraints

- **Read-only.** Do not modify files.
- **Manifests only.** Do not read source code. Reading a Python file to guess framework is out of scope — that's the user's job to confirm.
- **No guessing.** If a field is unclear, report `unknown`. The skill will ask the user to fill gaps.
- **No opinions.** Do not recommend changes, rewrites, or additions. Just report.
- **Token-budget conscious.** The final report should be under ~60 lines. Don't dump package.json contents.
